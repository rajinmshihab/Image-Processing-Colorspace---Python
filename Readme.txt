In our understanding of the world, we base a massive part of it on our basic senses. How it looks, smells, etc. plays a huge role in our vision of the world around us. We memorize things by associating them with their attributes. One of those attributes is their color. We can notice things in complex scenarios just because of their color. An object’s color is the wavelength of light the object rejects and reflects instead of absorbing. We use colors in complex operations as well. We have learned to how to digitally represent colors and use it to our advantage in many of our day-to-day activities. In this assignment, I will be trying to separate objects based on their color from still images.
To carry out this assignment, I will need to select a color space to work with. Color spaces are different specific organizations of color. They support digital/analog reproduceable presentations of colors and are built based on color models. Some of the well know color spaces are as follows:
•	RGB – The classic and one of the most popular color spaces. Uses a combination of Red, Green, Blue of determine colors. 
•	sRGB – Also known as the Standard RGB. It’s similar to the RGB color space but the range of sRGB is narrower.
•	CMYK – A subtractive color model space named after Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black). This color space can easily provide a wide mix of colors but fails to some extent to provide deep dark colors.
•	HSV – A color space that uses Hue, Saturation, and Value to determine colors close to a way that humans understand. This is contrary to the others that only use direct colors to do so.
I will be using the ‘HSV’ color space to complete this assignment. I will be using the related & necessary methods of image manipulation to achieve the target. The PyCharm IDE will be used. A python source program and a collection of reference images to use for further assessment will be provided along with it.


The primary objective of the assignment is to understand the processes and theories of image manipulation. We need to learn about the different algorithms that are used during different scenarios and how to analyze a scene using appropriate color model, pattern recognition and image processing techniques. Some steps must be followed to complete the task given. The steps to consider are as follows:
•	Trying out different color spaces to finalize one.
•	Trying out different pattern recognition algorithms and finalizing the ideal one.
•	Trying out different image manipulation techniques and choosing one. 
•	Trying out different segmentation techniques to finalize the ideal one. 
The final goal is to create a program that will take still images and identify the objects in the images via color space and be able to differentiate among them.
